    The continuous rise in temperature of the planet is really upsetting. The root cause for this is global warming. Global warming begins when sunlight reaches the Earth. The clouds, atmospheric particles, reflective ground surfaces and surface of oceans then sends back about 30 % of sunlight back into the space, whilst the remaining is absorbed by oceans, air and land. This consequently heats up the surface of the planet and atmosphere, making life feasible. As the Earth warms up, this solar energy is radiated by thermal radiation and infrared rays, propagating directly out to space thereby cooling the Earth. However, some of the outgoing radiation is re-absorbed by carbon dioxide, water vapours, ozone, methane and other gases in the atmosphere and is radiated back to the surface of Earth. These gases are commonly known as greenhouse gases due to their heat-trapping capacity. It must be noted that this re-absorption process is actually good as the Earth’s average surface temperature would be very cold if there was no existence of greenhouse gases. The dilemma began when the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was artificially increased by humankind at an alarming rate since the past two centuries. As of 2004, over 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide was pumped thermal radiation is further hindered by increased levels of greenhouse gases resulting in a phenomenon known as human enhanced global warming effect. Recent observations regarding global warming have substantiated the theory that it is indeed a human enhanced greenhouse effect that is causing the planet to heat up. The planet has experienced the largest increase in surface temperature over the last 100 years. Between 1906 and 2006, the Earth’s average surface temperature augmented between 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius, however the last 50 years saw the rate of temperature increase nearly doubling. Sea levels have shown a rise of about 0.17 meters during the 20th century. The extent of Arctic sea ice has steadily reduced by 2.7 % per decade since 1978.
out per year. Millions of pounds of methane gas are generated in landfills and agricultural decomposition of biomass and animal manure. Nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere by various nitrogen-based fertilizers including urea and diammonium phosphate and other soil management utilizations. Once released, these greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for decades or even longer. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, carbon dioxide and methane levels have increased by 35 % and 148 % since the industrial revolution of 1750.

       The major cause of global warming is the greenhouse gases. They include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides and in some cases chlorine and bromine containing compounds. The build-up of these gases in the atmosphere changes the radiative equilibrium in the atmosphere. Their overall effect is to warm the Earth’s surface and the lower atmosphere because greenhouse gases absorb some of the outgoing radiation of Earth and re-radiate it back towards the surface. The net warming from 1850 to the end of the 20th century was equivalent to nearly 2.5 W/m2 with carbon dioxide contribution about 60 % to this figure, methane about 25 per cent, with nitrous oxides and halocarbons providing the remainder. In 1985, Joe Farman, of the British Antarctic Survey, published an article showing the decrease in ozone levels over Antarctica during the early 1980s. The response was striking: large scale international scientific programmes were mounted to prove that CFCs (used as aerosol propellants in industrial cleaning fluids and in refrigeration tools) were the cause of the problem. Even more important was abrupt international action to curb the emissions of CFCs.The second major cause of global warming is the depletion of ozone layer. This happens mainly due to the presence of chlorine-containing source gases. When ultraviolet light is present, these gases dissociate releasing chlorine atoms which then catalyses ozone destruction. Aerosols present in the atmosphere are also causing global warming by changing the climate in two different ways. Firstly, they scatter and absorb solar and infrared radiation and secondly, they may alter the microphysical and chemical properties of clouds and perhaps affect their lifetime and extent. The scattering of solar radiation acts to cool the planet, while absorption of solar radiation by aerosols warms the air directly instead of permitting sunlight to be absorbed by the surface of the Earth. The human contribution to the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere is of various forms. For instance, dust is a by-product of agriculture. Biomass burning generates a mixture of organic droplets and soot particles. Many industrial processes produce a wide diversity of aerosols depending on what is being burned or generated in the manufacturing process. Moreover, exhaust emissions from various sorts of transport produce a rich mixture of pollutants that are either aerosols from the outset or are transformed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere to form aerosols.
V. Global Warming: The Effects
Predicting the consequences of global warming is one of the most difficult tasks faced by the climate researchers. This is due to the fact that natural processes that cause rain, snowfall, hailstorms, rise in sea levels is reliant on many diverse factors. Moreover, it is very hard to predict the size of emissions of greenhouse gases in the future years as this is determined majorly through technological advancements and political decisions. Global warming produces many negative effects some of which are described here. Firstly, extra water vapour which is present in the atmosphere falls again as rain which leads to floods in various regions of the world. When the weather turns warmer, evaporation process from both land and sea rises. This leads to drought in the regions where increased evaporation process is not compensated by increased precipitation. In some areas of the world, this will result in crop failure and famine particularly in areas where the temperatures are already high. The extra water vapour content in the atmosphere will fall again as extra rain hence causing flood. Towns and villages which are dependent on the melting water from snowy mountains may suffer drought and scarcity of water supply. It is because the glaciers all over the world are shrinking at a very rapid rate and melting of ice appears to be faster than previously projected. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), about one-sixth of the total population of the world lives in the regions which shall be affected by a decrease in melting water. The warmer climate will likely cause more heat waves, more violent rainfall and also amplification in the severity of hailstorms and thunderstorms. Rising of sea levels is the most deadly affect of global warming, the rise in temperature is causing the ice and glaciers to melt rapidly. This will lead to rise of water levels in oceans, rivers and lakes that can pilot devastation in the form of floods [6].
As evident from Fig. 5, temperature anomalies are projected to increase in coming years. Before, the 20th century, the situation was well under control but the beginning of the current century, the situation started to worsen .This was all due to increase in global warming majorly due to the fact that new industries and power houses started operation and emitted harmful gases which cause the planet to heat up. This data is based on the research carried out by different climate and environmental research agencies.

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">2018 Fourth hotest year?</h5>                     
      New government data on temperatures around the world offers cold comfort to those who hope that global warming is on the wane. The data, released on Wednesday by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), shows that 2018 was the fourth-hottest year since 1880, the earliest year for which reliable global temperature data is available.

The three hottest years on record were 2015, 2016 and 2017.According to National Aeronautics and Space Administration "In fact, the warmest five years in the record are just the last five years," Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, and one of the experts who described the new data in a Wednesday morning press briefing, told NBC News MACH in an email before the event. "The long-term trends toward warmer temperatures are clear and continuing.".The average global surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the 1880s, NASA data showed. NOAA, which uses different baselines and analyzes the data differently, found that global temperatures in 2018 were 1.42 degrees F (0.79 degrees C) above the 20th century average.The new report makes it clear that "global warming shows no sign of slowing down or stopping," Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an email.

Because weather patterns vary around the world, not every region experienced the same warming trend. Trends were strongest in the polar regions, which have seen continued loss of sea ice in the Arctic and shrinkage of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

In the contiguous U.S., 2018 was the 14th hottest year on record. Fourteen states had annual temperatures that were among the 10 highest on record. Arizona's temperatures in 2018 were the second highest on record, New Mexico's the third and California's fourth.

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">The Effects on living beings</h5>
      Global warming can severely affect the health of living beings. Excess heat can cause stress which may lead to blood pressure and heart diseases. Crop failures and famines, which are a direct consequence of heating up of earth, can cause a decline in human body resistance to viruses and infections. Global warming may also transfer various diseases to other regions as people will shift from regions of higher temperatures to regions of comparatively lower temperatures. Warmer oceans and other surface waters may lead to severe cholera outbreaks and harmful infections in some types of sea food.
Moreover, it is an established fact that warmer temperatures lead to dehydration which is a major cause of kidney stones. A medical team from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia examined the health proceedings of more than 60,000 Americans alongside weather records. They discovered that individuals were most likely to be hospitalized with kidney stones three days after a temperature rise. Since 1994, kidney stone incidence has risen from about one in 20 people to one in 11. This trend is likely to increase as the globe gets hotter. According to Luis Ostrosky, M.D. of the Division of Infectious Diseases at The University of Texas Health Science Centre at Houston Medical School and medical director for epidemiology at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Centre: “One infection that is definitely making a weird pattern is valley fever”. In his words, “This is a fungal infection we used to see only in California, Arizona, New Mexico and a little in Texas, but last year we found it for the first time in Washington State.”This potentially deadly condition caused apprehension in California when the number of cases increased drastically during 2010 and 2011. Valley fever infections have been on the rise, probably because of warming climates and drought causing dust storms. Dry soil and wind can carry spores that spread the virus. Hotter and drier climates are projected to increase the amount of dusting carrying this disease. Researchers have already noticed a rise in mosquito-borne disease like dengue fever and malaria due to warmer and longer summers. Perhaps the most prominent mosquito-borne disease, West Nile Virus, has already experienced a sharp increase in annual cases. According to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the summer of 2012 was the nastiest West Nile season on record,. The likely reason was that summer's scorching heat and drought. Lyme disease is another dangerous disease which is transmitted mainly through bites from certain tick species.
Fig. 8 describes in the form of a block diagram that how alterations in global climate can affect human health. The bitterest fact is that it can cause various diseases and deprive human beings of the food.

       The hazards caused by global warming are tremendous. Excessive use of fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil play a part in it too. The usage of fossil fuels should be discontinued immediately. The most significant solution to put an end to this disaster is the use of alternative energy sources. They include wind, solar, bio mass, geothermal and hydro. The most noteworthy point in using these sources is their clean nature. They do not produce any sort of pollution or toxic gases that can lead to global warming. They are environmentally friendly and pose no threat to ecological balance. However, their high installation and setup costs may drive energy companies away from them at first but in the long run they are surely beneficial for everyone. Most importantly, fossil fuels will deplete one day and sooner or later, we have to turn to renewable energy sources for energy production. Thus, the eventual solution to end global warming is to use alternative energy sources. Fig. 9 depicts in a pictorial way that earth can be saved from the hazards of global warming if we utilise renewable energy sources. 
       Global warming is also affecting animals. They need to move to cooler places in order to survive. This process has been observed in various places, for instance, in the Alps, in mountainous Queensland in Australia, and in the misty forests of Costa Rica. Fish in the North Sea have been reported to move northwards too .The impacts on species are becoming noteworthy to such an extent that their movements can be used as a sign of a warming world. They are the silent witnesses of the swift changes being inflicted on the Earth. Scientists and researchers predict that global warming is gradually damaging the ecosystems of various species and is playing a very unconstructive role in making them extinct. For instance Asia’s only ape – the orang-utan – is in bottomless trouble. Its last remaining strongholds in the rainforests of Indonesia are being endangered by a range of pressures, including climate change, putting the animal at the menace of extinction within a few decades. With global warming continually increasing the duration and frequency of droughts, bushfires are occurring more often in these heavily logged forests, further fragmenting the orang-utan’s living domain. Similarly, in Africa, elephants face a series of threats including shrinking living space, which brings them more regularly into divergence with people. With this reduced living space, elephants will be unable to escape any changes to their natural habitat caused by renewables. These countries should extend their helping hand to developing countries to combat the evil of global warming collectively. Using renewable energy is the most effective way to curtain the emission of gases which play a major role in global warming.
Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show that the use of renewables is gradually increasing. The figure should be much more than present so that we can tackle the problem of global warming timely and effectively.should use the philosophy of automobile advertisements to encourage drivers to conserve energy and reduce pollution. Awareness campaigns can be started using placards, posters and logos similar to shown in Figures 12-14. They are a very useful way to demonstrate that global warming is not good for the planet. Recycling is also a good way to reduce global warming. People should use rechargeable batteries instead of disposable ones. Quality products should be bought that have a long life. Shopping should be done from local markets which reduce transportation. Even small individual efforts like lowering the thermostats in winter and using compact fluorescent lamps instead of incandescent lamps can aid to address the issue of global warming. Reforestation schemes must be started to grow a large number of trees. Forest degradation and deforestation must be discouraged at government level. Nuclear power is also a possible solution as this power results in fewer emissions but this method should be used with care as it can lead to severe accidents therefore, the major hurdle is to overcome the security, propagation, waste disposal and high costs of nuclear power if this method has to be made practical

    <h5 class="mt-0">Solutions</h5>
    
As elaborated earlier, toxic emissions are a major cause of global warming, A likely solution to reduce harmful emissions is to cut the usage of vehicles which produce them. This has not been met with much success as many people refuse to cut down their practice of using cars. No doubt, some people have started to use bicycles and public transport, whereas some other prefer to walk but these numbers are relatively small. It should be noted that fuel economy and emission rates are chief factors to consider regarding the car choice. Hybrid cars have higher efficiency and lower emission rates. Keeping the tires inflated will help improve mileage and air filters should be frequently replaced to cut down harmful emissions. People should share the ride with friends or co-workers to reduce the total number of vehicles on the road. Print and social media can play an effective role in curbing the problem.
